### Step 3: Add to GitHub Secrets

#### For Spring-Backend Repository:

Repeat the above steps for each repository where you want to use Agent OS.

### Step 4: Verify Setup

Run this command to check if the secret is set:
```bash
gh secret list --repo securedotcom/Spring-Backend
```

You should see `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` in the list.

### Step 5: Test the Integration

Trigger a manual workflow run:

```

Monitor the run:

**Solution**:
1. Verify secret name is exactly `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`

### Issue: "Rate limit exceeded"
**Cause**: Too many API calls
**Solution**:
1. Check your Anthropic usage dashboard
