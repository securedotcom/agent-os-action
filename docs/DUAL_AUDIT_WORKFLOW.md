# Dual-Audit Security Workflow

## Overview

The Dual-Audit workflow provides **high-confidence security assessment** by running two independent AI-powered security audits:

1. **Argus (Anthropic Claude)**: Comprehensive security analysis with multi-scanner orchestration
2. **Codex (OpenAI GPT-5.2)**: Independent validation and cross-verification

This approach reduces false positives, increases detection accuracy, and provides consensus-based findings.

---

## Why Dual-Audit?

### Benefits

✅ **Higher Confidence**: Two independent AI models validate findings
✅ **Reduced False Positives**: Consensus approach filters noise
✅ **Comprehensive Coverage**: Different models catch different issues
✅ **Cross-Validation**: Findings confirmed by both tools are highly reliable
✅ **Best of Both Worlds**: Combines Anthropic + OpenAI strengths

### Use Cases

- **Production deployments**: Critical systems requiring high confidence
- **Compliance audits**: Regulatory requirements needing validation
- **Security reviews**: Pre-release security assessment
- **Continuous monitoring**: Automated security checks in CI/CD

## Best Practices

### 1. Run on Clean Code

- Ensure code is linted and formatted
- Fix obvious issues before audit
- Commit changes before running

### 2. Review Both Reports

- Don't rely solely on the comparison report
- Review Argus detailed findings
- Check Codex validation reasoning

### 3. Validate False Positives

- Use human judgment for disputed findings
- Check if flagged secrets are examples/placeholders
- Verify context of vulnerabilities

### 4. Track Metrics Over Time

```bash
# Save metrics for trending
cp .argus/dual-audit/TIMESTAMP/dual_audit_report.md \
   security-reports/$(date +%Y%m%d)-dual-audit.md
```

### 5. Automate Remediation

- Create GitHub issues from findings
- Assign to responsible teams
- Track fix timelines

---

## Troubleshooting

### Argus Fails

```bash
# Check API key
echo $ANTHROPIC_API_KEY

# Verify dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run manually
python scripts/run_ai_audit.py /path/to/repo backend-api
```

### Codex Fails

```bash
# Check Codex installation
which codex

# Re-login
codex logout
codex login

# Verify access
codex --version
```

### Timeout Issues

For large repositories:

```python
# Edit scripts/dual_audit.py
# Increase timeout values:
timeout=1200  # 20 minutes instead of 10
```

---

## Cost Estimation

### Per Audit

| Tool | Cost | Duration |
|------|------|----------|
| Argus (Claude) | $0.20-0.50 | 2-5 min |
| Codex (GPT-5.2) | Included* | 1-3 min |
| **Total** | **$0.20-0.50** | **3-8 min** |

*Codex requires OpenAI subscription

### Monthly (100 repos, weekly scans)

- Argus: 400 audits × $0.35 = **$140/month**
- Codex: Included in subscription
- **Total: ~$140/month + Codex subscription**

## LLM-as-a-Judge Methodology

This section documents the advanced evaluation methodology used to assess LLM performance and maintain quality standards in the dual-audit workflow.

### Methodology Overview

The LLM-as-a-Judge approach evaluates security finding quality through systematic comparison of independent AI analysis. This methodology is inspired by [Evidently AI's research](https://www.evidentlyai.com/) on Large Language Model evaluation and ensures:

- **Objectivity**: Consensus-based rather than single-model dependent
- **Reproducibility**: Deterministic scoring and classification
- **Interpretability**: Clear reasoning chains for each judgment
- **Alignment**: Findings aligned with human security expert judgment

### 5-Point Scoring Rubric

Each finding is evaluated across five dimensions:

#### 1. **Accuracy (0-1.0)**
- Does the finding correctly identify a real vulnerability?
- Is the severity level appropriate?
- Are false positives eliminated?

**Scoring:**
- 1.0: Finding is factually correct, confirmed by both agents
- 0.8: Finding is mostly correct with minor severity misclassification
- 0.6: Finding is partially correct but misses nuance
- 0.4: Finding has significant issues but some validity
- 0.0: Finding is incorrect or completely false positive

#### 2. **Completeness (0-1.0)**
- Does the finding include all necessary context?
- Are affected files/functions clearly identified?
- Is the impact explained?

**Scoring:**
- 1.0: Complete information provided by both agents
- 0.8: Mostly complete, minor details missing
- 0.6: Contains core information but lacks context
- 0.4: Vague or poorly explained
- 0.0: Incomplete or unusable

#### 3. **Actionability (0-1.0)**
- Can a developer fix this issue based on the finding?
- Are remediation steps clear and practical?
- Is the fix feasible?

**Scoring:**
- 1.0: Clear steps to remediate, both agents provide guidance
- 0.8: Generally clear with minor ambiguity
- 0.6: Developer must do some research
- 0.4: Vague guidance
- 0.0: Not actionable

#### 4. **Risk Assessment (0-1.0)**
- Is the severity level accurate?
- Is business impact explained?
- Is exploitability realistic?

**Scoring:**
- 1.0: Severity accurate, impact clear, exploit chain realistic
- 0.8: Mostly accurate assessment
- 0.6: Reasonable but may over/understate risk
- 0.4: Significant risk assessment errors
- 0.0: Completely inaccurate

#### 5. **Confidence (0-1.0)**
- How confident are both agents in this finding?
- Is uncertainty acknowledged?
- Has the finding been validated by both tools?

**Scoring:**
- 1.0: Both agents unanimous (100% agreement)
- 0.85: Strong agreement (67%+ consensus)
- 0.70: Majority agreement (50%+ consensus)
- 0.50: Weak agreement (<50% consensus)
- 0.0: Complete disagreement or one agent only

### Overall Quality Score

```
Quality Score = (Accuracy + Completeness + Actionability + Risk Assessment + Confidence) / 5
```

**Interpretation:**
- **0.9-1.0**: Excellent - Immediate remediation recommended
- **0.7-0.89**: Good - High confidence, schedule remediation
- **0.5-0.69**: Fair - Medium confidence, requires validation
- **0.3-0.49**: Poor - Low confidence, likely false positive
- **0.0-0.29**: Reject - Very likely false positive

### Chain-of-Thought Reasoning

Both Argus and Codex provide explicit reasoning for each judgment:

**Argus (Claude) Analysis Process:**
1. Threat modeling identifies attack vectors
2. Code review traces vulnerability paths
3. Impact assessment evaluates risk
4. Recommendation synthesis provides fixes

**Codex (OpenAI) Validation Process:**
1. Independent vulnerability identification
2. Cross-reference with Argus findings
3. Agreement/disagreement assessment
4. Additional issues identification

**Combined Chain-of-Thought Output:**
Each finding includes:
```json
{
  "finding": "SQL Injection in user_search.py:42",
  "severity": "critical",
  "reasoning": {
    "argus": "User input from search_query parameter is directly interpolated into SQL query without parameterization, allowing attacker to execute arbitrary SQL commands",
    "codex": "Confirmed: Line 42 builds SQL with f-string concatenation of untrusted user input. Attack surface: search functionality is publicly exposed",
    "consensus": "Both agents identified identical vulnerability with consistent severity assessment"
  },
  "evidence": [
    "Line 42: query = f\"SELECT * FROM users WHERE name = '{search_query}'\"",
    "No parameterized queries used",
    "Input validation absent"
  ],
  "remediation": "Use parameterized queries with database driver's prepared statement API"
}
```

### Agreement Metrics

#### Cohen's Kappa (Concordance)

Measures agreement between two raters (Argus and Codex):

```
κ = (p_o - p_e) / (1 - p_e)

where:
p_o = observed agreement probability
p_e = expected agreement by chance
```

**Interpretation:**
- **κ = 1.0**: Perfect agreement
- **κ = 0.81-1.0**: Almost perfect agreement
- **κ = 0.61-0.80**: Substantial agreement
- **κ = 0.41-0.60**: Moderate agreement
- **κ = 0.21-0.40**: Fair agreement
- **κ < 0.20**: Slight/poor agreement

**Example Calculation:**
```
Argus findings: 18 total
Codex findings: 20 total
Agreements (both found same issue): 15
Expected by chance: ~10

κ = (15 - 10) / (1 - 10/18) ≈ 0.74 (Substantial agreement)
```

#### Precision and Recall

**Precision** (False Positive Rate):
```
Precision = True Positives / (True Positives + False Positives)

Example: 15 real issues found, 3 false positives
Precision = 15 / (15 + 3) = 0.833 (83.3% accurate)
```

**Recall** (Detection Rate):
```
Recall = True Positives / (True Positives + False Negatives)

Example: 15 real issues found, 2 missed
Recall = 15 / (15 + 2) = 0.882 (88.2% coverage)
```

**F1 Score** (Harmonic Mean):
```
F1 = 2 * (Precision * Recall) / (Precision + Recall)

Example: F1 = 2 * (0.833 * 0.882) / (0.833 + 0.882) = 0.857
```

### Pairwise Comparison Mode

For detailed analysis, the system can run in pairwise comparison mode:

```bash
python scripts/dual_audit.py /path/to/repo \
  --comparison-mode pairwise \
  --detailed-metrics
```

**Output includes:**
1. Finding-by-finding comparison matrix
2. Agreement score for each severity level
3. Category-wise coverage analysis
4. Confidence distribution charts

**Example Output:**
```

High:     83% agreement (5/6 findings match)
Medium:   67% agreement (2/3 findings match)
Low:      100% agreement (2/2 findings match)
```

### Monitoring and Drift Detection

The system continuously monitors LLM quality metrics to detect performance degradation:

#### Quality Drift Detection

```python
# Track finding quality over time
quality_history = [
    {"date": "2026-01-01", "accuracy": 0.93, "precision": 0.91, "recall": 0.88},
    {"date": "2026-01-08", "accuracy": 0.89, "precision": 0.87, "recall": 0.85},  # ⚠️ Drift detected
    {"date": "2026-01-14", "accuracy": 0.86, "precision": 0.84, "recall": 0.82},  # ⚠️ Worsening
]

# Trigger alert if:
# - Accuracy drops >5% week-over-week
# - Precision drops below 0.85
# - F1 score drops >0.10
```

#### Metrics Tracked

| Metric | Target | Alert Threshold |
|--------|--------|-----------------|
| Accuracy | 0.90+ | < 0.85 |
| Precision | 0.90+ | < 0.85 |
| Recall | 0.85+ | < 0.80 |
| Cohen's Kappa | 0.80+ | < 0.70 |
| F1 Score | 0.87+ | < 0.80 |
| False Positive Rate | < 10% | > 15% |
| Consensus Rate | > 80% | < 70% |

#### Automated Actions on Drift

When drift is detected:
1. **Log Alert**: Write to monitoring dashboard
2. **Notify Team**: Send alert to security team
3. **Fallback Model**: Switch to more conservative model
4. **Manual Review**: Flag findings for human validation
5. **Root Cause Analysis**: Determine drift cause
