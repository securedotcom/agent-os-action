# Agent OS Limitations & Human Oversight Guide

**Version**: 1.0.15  
**Last Updated**: October 27, 2025

---

## üéØ Purpose

This document outlines the current limitations of Agent OS Code Reviewer and provides guidance on when human oversight is essential. **AI should augment human code review, not replace it.**

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Current Limitations

### 1. LLM API Dependency

**Issue**: Requires external API keys for AI analysis

**Impact**:
- Setup complexity (API key required)
- External service dependency
- Potential API rate limits
- Network connectivity required (except Ollama)

**Mitigation**:
‚úÖ **IMPLEMENTED**: Multi-LLM support
- Anthropic Claude (recommended)
- OpenAI GPT-4 (alternative)
- Ollama (local, free, no API key)

**Usage**:
```yaml
# Option 1: Anthropic (best quality)
with:
  anthropic-api-key: ${{ secrets.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY }}

# Option 2: OpenAI (good quality)
with:
  ai-provider: 'openai'
  openai-api-key: ${{ secrets.OPENAI_API_KEY }}

# Option 3: Ollama (free, local)
with:
  ai-provider: 'ollama'
  ollama-endpoint: 'http://localhost:11434'
```

**Fallback**: If no API key is provided, the action will fail with clear instructions on how to set up each provider.

### 2. File/Language Boundaries

**Issue**: File count limits and language prioritization

**Current Limits**:
- Default: 50 files (configurable up to 100+)
- File size: 50KB max per file
- Prioritized languages: JS, TS, Python, Java, Go, Rust, Ruby, PHP, C#, Scala, Kotlin

**Impact on Large Polyglot Codebases**:
- May not analyze all files in very large repos (1000+ files)
- Some languages may be skipped
- Complex platform teams with diverse tech stacks may need tuning

**Mitigation**:
‚úÖ **IMPLEMENTED**: Enhanced file selection
- Configurable `max-files` (up to 100+)
- Priority-based file selection:
  - **Highest**: Changed files (PR mode)
  - **High**: Security-sensitive files (auth, crypto, secrets)
  - **High**: API/Controllers (routes, handlers, endpoints)
  - **Medium**: Business logic (services, models, repositories)
- Extended language support (20+ languages)
- Path filtering with `include-paths` and `exclude-paths`

**Best Practices**:
```yaml
# For large codebases
with:
  max-files: 100                    # Increase limit
  include-paths: 'src/**,lib/**'    # Focus on source code
  exclude-paths: 'test/**,vendor/**' # Skip tests and dependencies

# For PR reviews (most efficient)
with:
  only-changed: 'true'              # Only review changed files
  max-files: 50                     # Sufficient for most PRs
```

**Workaround for Very Large Codebases** (1000+ files):
1. Run multiple targeted audits:
   ```yaml
   # Audit 1: Security-critical
   include-paths: 'auth/**,security/**,api/**'
   
   # Audit 2: Business logic
   include-paths: 'services/**,models/**'
   
   # Audit 3: Frontend
   include-paths: 'components/**,pages/**'
   ```

2. Use PR mode for incremental reviews:
   ```yaml
   only-changed: 'true'  # Reviews only what changed
   ```

### 3. Human Oversight Required

**Issue**: AI cannot replace human judgment for all aspects of code review

**What AI Does Well** ‚úÖ:
- Identifying common security vulnerabilities (SQL injection, XSS, hardcoded secrets)
- Detecting performance anti-patterns (N+1 queries, memory leaks)
- Finding missing error handling
- Spotting code quality issues (unused variables, dead code)
- Checking test coverage gaps
- Enforcing coding standards

**What Requires Human Judgment** ‚ö†Ô∏è:
1. **Architectural Decisions**
   - System design trade-offs
   - Technology stack choices
   - Scalability considerations
   - Microservices vs monolith decisions

2. **Business Logic Correctness**
   - Domain-specific requirements
   - Business rule validation
   - Edge case handling
   - Regulatory compliance

3. **Context-Specific Security**
   - Threat modeling for specific use cases
   - Security vs usability trade-offs
   - Organization-specific security policies
   - Compliance requirements (HIPAA, PCI-DSS, etc.)

4. **Code Maintainability**
   - Team coding conventions
   - Readability for specific team
   - Documentation adequacy
   - Refactoring priorities

5. **Performance Trade-offs**
   - Premature optimization decisions
   - Cost vs performance balance
   - Acceptable latency for use case

**Recommended Workflow**:
```
1. AI Review (Automated)
   ‚Üì
2. Human Review (Required)
   ‚Üì
3. Merge Decision
```

**AI Review Report Sections**:
Every report includes a "Human Review Required" section highlighting areas needing human judgment.

### 4. No IDE Integration Yet

**Issue**: No real-time feedback in IDE during development

**Current State**:
- Reviews run in CI/CD pipeline
- Manual trigger via GitHub Actions
- CLI tool available but not IDE-integrated

**Impact**:
- Developers don't get immediate feedback while coding
- Issues found after commit/push
- Slower feedback loop than IDE linters

**Planned** (Roadmap):
- VS Code extension (Q1 2026)
- Cursor IDE integration (Q1 2026)
- JetBrains plugin (Q2 2026)

**Current Workarounds**:

1. **Local CLI Tool** (Available Now):
   ```bash
   # Install Agent OS globally
   curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/securedotcom/agent-os-action/main/install-global.sh | bash
   
   # Run review locally
   agent-os review --path . --type audit
   ```

2. **Pre-commit Hook**:
   ```bash
   # .git/hooks/pre-commit
   #!/bin/bash
   agent-os review --path . --only-changed
   ```

3. **Fast PR Reviews** (< 5 minutes):
   ```yaml
   # Trigger on every push
   on:
     pull_request:
       types: [opened, synchronize]
   
   with:
     only-changed: 'true'  # Fast feedback
     max-files: 25
   ```

---

### 5. Metrics/Dashboarding

**Issue**: Limited real-time analytics and team insights

**Current State**:
- Metrics saved to JSON files
- Basic GitHub Actions outputs
- No centralized dashboard
- No historical trend analysis

**Available Now**:
- `metrics.json`: Per-run metrics
- `results.json`: Structured findings
- GitHub Actions artifacts
- SARIF upload to Code Scanning

**Missing** (Roadmap):
- Real-time code quality dashboard
- Team analytics and leaderboards
- DORA metrics integration
- Trend analysis over time
- Developer productivity insights
- Custom alerts and notifications

**Planned Features** (Q1-Q2 2026):
1. **Code Quality Dashboard**
   - Real-time metrics
   - Historical trends
   - Team comparison
   - Repository health scores

2. **DORA Metrics**
   - Deployment frequency
   - Lead time for changes
   - Change failure rate
   - Time to restore service

3. **Team Analytics**
   - Code review velocity
   - Issue resolution time
   - Developer productivity
   - Technical debt tracking

**Current Workarounds**:

1. **Extract Metrics from JSON**:
   ```bash
   # Get metrics from latest run
   jq '.summary' .agent-os/reviews/metrics.json
   ```

2. **GitHub Actions Summary**:
   ```yaml
   - name: Post Metrics
     run: |
       echo "## üìä Code Review Metrics" >> $GITHUB_STEP_SUMMARY
       echo "Cost: \$${{ steps.review.outputs.cost-estimate }}" >> $GITHUB_STEP_SUMMARY
       echo "Files: ${{ steps.review.outputs.files-analyzed }}" >> $GITHUB_STEP_SUMMARY
   ```

3. **Custom Dashboard** (DIY):
   ```python
   # Aggregate metrics from multiple runs
   import json
   import glob
   
   metrics = []
   for file in glob.glob('.agent-os/reviews/*/metrics.json'):
       with open(file) as f:
           metrics.append(json.load(f))
   
   # Analyze trends
   avg_cost = sum(m['cost_usd'] for m in metrics) / len(metrics)
   ```

## üéØ Best Practices

### 1. Use AI as First Pass, Not Final Word
```
‚úÖ AI finds common issues automatically
‚úÖ Human reviews AI findings + context
‚úÖ Human makes final merge decision
```

### 2. Configure for Your Codebase Size
```yaml
# Small codebase (<10K LOC)
max-files: 50

# Medium codebase (10K-50K LOC)
max-files: 75
include-paths: 'src/**,lib/**'

# Large codebase (50K-100K LOC)
max-files: 100
include-paths: 'critical/**,api/**'
only-changed: 'true'  # For PRs

# Very large (100K+ LOC)
# Run multiple targeted audits
```

### 3. Choose Right AI Provider
```yaml
# Best quality (recommended)
anthropic-api-key: ${{ secrets.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY }}

# Good quality, alternative
ai-provider: 'openai'
openai-api-key: ${{ secrets.OPENAI_API_KEY }}

# Free, local, privacy-focused
ai-provider: 'ollama'
ollama-endpoint: 'http://localhost:11434'
```

### 4. Balance Cost vs Coverage
```yaml
# Full audit (weekly)
max-files: 100
cost-limit: '1.0'

# PR review (per PR)
only-changed: 'true'
max-files: 25
cost-limit: '0.25'
```

### 5. Document Human Review Requirements
```markdown
# PR Template
## AI Review
- [ ] AI review passed
- [ ] Critical issues resolved

## Human Review Required
- [ ] Architecture reviewed
- [ ] Business logic validated
- [ ] Security context assessed
- [ ] Performance trade-offs evaluated
```
