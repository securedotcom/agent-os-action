### Step 2: Install GitHub App
1. Click "Install app" or "Configure" if already partially installed
2. Search for "GitHub" (the official app by GitHub)
3. Click "Install"

### Step 3: Configure Repository Access
Choose one of these options:

**Option A: All Repositories (Recommended)**
- Select "All repositories"

### Step 4: Grant Permissions
The app will request these permissions (all are safe and standard):
- ✅ Read access to code
- ✅ Read and write access to issues and pull requests
- ✅ Read access to metadata
- ✅ Webhook events for notifications

Click "Install" to complete.

## What This Enables

Once installed, team members can:
- ✅ Receive PR notifications in Slack channels

---

## Security & Privacy

## Questions?

**What is this for?**
We've implemented an automated code review system (Agent OS Code Reviewer) that creates PRs with security and quality findings. The GitHub app will notify us in Slack when these PRs are created or updated.

**Is this safe?**
Yes, this is the official GitHub app for Slack, used by thousands of companies including major enterprises.

**Can we limit access?**
Yes, you can choose which repositories the app has access to during installation.

**Can we uninstall it later?**
Yes, you can uninstall or reconfigure the app anytime from organization settings.

## Alternative: Temporary Workaround

If the app installation needs approval/review, we can temporarily use:
1. Email notifications (GitHub → Email → Slack email integration)
2. Webhook-based notifications (requires more setup)
3. Manual PR monitoring

But the GitHub app is the simplest and most powerful solution.
