**Documentation:** Coming in v1.2.0 - See [Security Features Roadmap](SECURITY_FEATURES_ROADMAP.md)

### API Security Testing

Comprehensive API vulnerability detection:

- **OWASP API Top 10 Coverage:**
  - API1:2023 Broken Object Level Authorization (BOLA/IDOR)
  - API2:2023 Broken Authentication
  - API3:2023 Broken Object Property Level Authorization

## 📖 Use Cases

Real-world scenarios:

### PR Security Gate

Block PRs with verified threats:

```yaml
- uses: securedotcom/agent-os-action@v1
  with:
    anthropic-api-key: ${{ secrets.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY }}
    fail-on-blockers: 'true'
    only-changed: 'true'
```

**Benefits:** Prevents vulnerabilities from reaching production

### Scheduled Security Audit

Weekly comprehensive scans:

```yaml
on:
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 2 * * 0'  # Sundays at 2 AM
```

**Benefits:** Catch new CVEs and configuration drift

### Local Development

Fast feedback during development:

```bash
python scripts/run_ai_audit.py --only-changed --max-files 20
```

**Benefits:** Fix security issues before committing

### Compliance Reporting

SOC 2, PCI-DSS audit reports:

```bash
./scripts/agentos gate --stage release --sbom-present
```

**Benefits:** Automated compliance validation

- **[GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/securedotcom/agent-os-action/discussions)** - Community Q&A

### Quick Fixes

**"Cost limit exceeded"** → Use Ollama (free) or increase limit
**"Scanner X not found"** → Scanners auto-install on first run
**"Too many false positives"** → Enable AI triage with Claude
**"Agent-OS is too slow"** → Use `--only-changed` and `--max-files 50`

See [README.md Troubleshooting](../README.md#troubleshooting) for more.
