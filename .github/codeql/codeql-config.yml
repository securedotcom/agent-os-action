# IMPORTANT: Only analyze these languages
# Do NOT include 'actions' - it causes analysis failures

# Explicitly exclude 'actions' language
# GitHub Actions workflows are simple YAML - don't need deep analysis
# This prevents the "CodeQL detected code written in GitHub Actions but could not process any of it" error
