## Common Themes

### What Teams Love

1. **Instant Feedback** - 5 minutes instead of days
2. **Noise Reduction** - 60-90% fewer false positives
3. **Real Vulnerabilities Found** - Issues other tools missed
4. **Developer Buy-in** - Easy to integrate, doesn't slow down workflow
5. **Cost Effective** - High ROI, especially with Ollama

### Common Use Cases

1. **Pull Request Reviews** (Most common)
2. **Pre-commit Hooks** (For fast feedback)
3. **Scheduled Nightly Scans** (For full repo analysis)
4. **Compliance Reporting** (SOC 2, PCI-DSS, HIPAA)
5. **Security Audits** (Replace expensive consultants)

### Success Factors

✅ **Start Small** - Pilot on one repo, expand after success  
✅ **Integrate Early** - Add to PR process from day one  
✅ **Show Metrics** - Track time saved, vulnerabilities found  
✅ **Get Buy-in** - Demo to developers, show value quickly  
✅ **Iterate** - Tune configuration based on feedback
