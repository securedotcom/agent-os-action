# AI Disclaimer Standard

Standard disclaimer for AI-generated documentation.

## Purpose

The AI disclaimer serves to:
1. Clearly identify AI-generated content
2. Set expectations for review
3. Encourage human validation
4. Maintain transparency
5. Build trust

## Standard Disclaimer

### Full Disclaimer

Use at the top of AI-generated documents:

```markdown
> ⚠️ **AI-Generated Documentation**
> This page was generated or updated by an AI agent.
> Please review and approve before treating it as canonical documentation.
```

### Variations by Document Type

#### Architecture Documentation
```markdown
> ⚠️ **AI-Generated Documentation**
> This architecture documentation was generated by analyzing the codebase.
> Please review and validate that it accurately reflects the system design.
```

#### ADRs
```markdown
> ⚠️ **AI-Generated Documentation**
> This ADR was generated by an AI agent based on codebase analysis.
> Please review and validate the context, decision, and consequences.
```

#### RFCs
```markdown
> ⚠️ **AI-Generated RFC Draft**
> This RFC was drafted by an AI agent based on codebase analysis.
> It requires human review, validation, and discussion before implementation.
```

#### Runbooks
```markdown
> ⚠️ **AI-Generated Documentation**
> This runbook was generated by an AI agent.
> Please review and validate all procedures before using in production.
```

#### ML Documentation
```markdown
> ⚠️ **AI-Generated Documentation**
> This ML documentation was generated by analyzing model files and training code.
> Please review and validate all technical details, especially metrics and performance claims.
```

#### Configuration References
```markdown
> ⚠️ **AI-Generated Documentation**
> This configuration reference was generated by scanning the codebase.
> Please review for accuracy and completeness. **Never expose actual secret values.**
```

## Placement

### Primary Placement
Place immediately after frontmatter, before the main heading:

```markdown
---
title: Document Title
ai_generated: true
---

> ⚠️ **AI-Generated Documentation**
> This page was generated or updated by an AI agent.
> Please review and approve before treating it as canonical documentation.

# Document Title

[Content...]
```

### Frontmatter Flag
Always include in frontmatter:

```yaml
---
title: Document Title
ai_generated: true  # ← Required
last_updated: 2024-11-07
---
```

## Uncertainty Markers

### When Information is Uncertain

Use inline markers for uncertain information:

```markdown
The service **appears to use** PostgreSQL based on the presence of `pg` library.

**TODO**: Verify database choice and reasoning.
```

### When Evidence is Weak

```markdown
## Context

Based on limited evidence, the system **may have** the following architecture.

**⚠️ Note**: This analysis is based on partial information. Human review is essential.
```

### When Guessing

Don't guess. Instead:

```markdown
## Database Configuration

**TODO**: Unable to determine database configuration from available code.
Please add this information manually.
```

## Review Prompts

### Inline Review Prompts

Add specific review requests:

```markdown
## Performance Metrics

**TODO**: Add actual performance metrics after load testing.

**Review Required**: Validate these metrics with the team.
```

### Section-Level Prompts

```markdown
## Deployment Procedure

> **⚠️ Review Required**
> These deployment steps were inferred from CI/CD configuration.
> Please verify they are accurate and complete before using.

[Deployment steps...]
```

## Human Review Indicators

### After Human Review

When a human has reviewed and approved:

1. Update frontmatter:
```yaml
---
title: Document Title
ai_generated: true
human_reviewed: true  # ← Add this
last_human_review: 2024-11-07
reviewer: john.doe@example.com
---
```

2. Optionally update disclaimer:
```markdown
> ⚠️ **AI-Generated Documentation** (Reviewed 2024-11-07)
> This page was generated by an AI agent and reviewed by the team.
> Last reviewed: 2024-11-07 by John Doe
```

### Removing Disclaimer

Only remove disclaimer when:
1. Content has been thoroughly reviewed
2. Content has been significantly edited by humans
3. Team agrees content is canonical
4. `human_reviewed: true` is set

## Disclaimer Styling

### Markdown Blockquote

Use blockquote with warning emoji:

```markdown
> ⚠️ **AI-Generated Documentation**
> Message here.
```

### Docusaurus Admonition (Alternative)

If using Docusaurus admonitions:

```markdown
:::warning AI-Generated Documentation
This page was generated or updated by an AI agent.
Please review and approve before treating it as canonical documentation.
:::
```

## Best Practices

### Do's
✅ Always include disclaimer on AI-generated docs
✅ Be specific about what needs review
✅ Mark uncertain information clearly
✅ Update disclaimer after human review
✅ Use consistent wording

### Don'ts
❌ Don't hide that content is AI-generated
❌ Don't remove disclaimer without review
❌ Don't use vague language
❌ Don't make claims without evidence
❌ Don't guess when uncertain

## Examples

### Good Disclaimer Usage

```markdown
---
title: API Service Architecture
ai_generated: true
---

> ⚠️ **AI-Generated Documentation**
> This architecture documentation was generated by analyzing the codebase.
> Please review and validate that it accurately reflects the system design.

# API Service Architecture

## Overview

The API service is a Node.js application using Express.js framework.

**Evidence**: Based on `package.json` dependencies and `src/index.ts` structure.

## Database

The service **appears to use** PostgreSQL based on the presence of `pg` library
in dependencies.

**TODO**: Verify database choice and document the reasoning behind it.
```

### Bad Disclaimer Usage

```markdown
# API Service Architecture

The API service uses PostgreSQL, Redis, and Kafka. It's built with Node.js
and deployed on Kubernetes.

[No disclaimer, no evidence, too certain]
```

## Localization

For non-English documentation, translate the disclaimer:

### Spanish
```markdown
> ⚠️ **Documentación Generada por IA**
> Esta página fue generada o actualizada por un agente de IA.
> Por favor revise y apruebe antes de tratarla como documentación canónica.
```

### French
```markdown
> ⚠️ **Documentation Générée par IA**
> Cette page a été générée ou mise à jour par un agent IA.
> Veuillez examiner et approuver avant de la traiter comme documentation canonique.
```

## Configuration

From `config.yml`:

```yaml
ai_disclaimer: |
  > ⚠️ **AI-Generated Documentation**
  > This page was generated or updated by an AI agent.
  > Please review and approve before treating it as canonical documentation.
```
