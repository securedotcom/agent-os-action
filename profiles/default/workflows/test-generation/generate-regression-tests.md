# Generate Regression Tests Workflow

## Objective
Create tests that prevent the vulnerability from being re-introduced in the future.

## Steps

1. **Design Regression Test**
   - Test the fixed behavior
   - Verify security controls are in place
   - Check that fix handles edge cases
   - Validate fix doesn't break functionality

2. **Create Long-Lived Test**
   - Use clear, descriptive test names
   - Add detailed comments
   - Include vulnerability reference
   - Document the fix

3. **Integrate with CI/CD**
   - Add to regular test suite
   - Mark as critical (should not be skipped)
   - Add to pre-commit hooks if applicable
   - Include in security test reports

## Regression Test Template

```python
def test_regression_vuln_001_sql_injection():
    """
    Regression test for VULN-001: SQL Injection in User Search

    This test ensures that the SQL injection vulnerability fixed in
    commit abc123 does not get re-introduced.

    The fix implemented parameterized queries instead of string concatenation.
    This test verifies that parameterized queries are still in use.

    If this test fails, it means:
    - The parameterized query implementation was removed
    - The vulnerable string concatenation was re-introduced
    - The input validation was weakened

    References:
    - Vulnerability Report: VULN-001
    - Fix Commit: abc123
    - Security Standard: OWASP A03:2021 Injection
    """
    # Test implementation verifying the fix
    pass
```

## Output
Regression tests integrated into the test suite.
