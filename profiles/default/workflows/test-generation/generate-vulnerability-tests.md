# Generate Vulnerability Tests Workflow

## Objective
Generate comprehensive unit tests that verify vulnerability is fixed.

## Steps

1. **Create Test File**
   - Follow project test naming conventions
   - Place in appropriate test directory
   - Use correct framework imports

2. **Generate Test Cases**

   **Positive Tests** (Verify vulnerability is blocked):
   - Test with known malicious payloads
   - Verify proper error handling
   - Check that sensitive data is not exposed
   - Validate security controls are enforced

   **Negative Tests** (Verify legitimate use still works):
   - Test with valid inputs
   - Verify normal functionality
   - Check expected behavior is maintained

   **Boundary Tests**:
   - Test edge cases
   - Test with empty/null inputs
   - Test with maximum length inputs
   - Test with special characters

3. **Add Test Documentation**
   - Link to vulnerability ID
   - Explain what is being tested
   - Document expected vs. actual behavior
   - Add references to security standards

4. **Parameterize Tests**
   - Use test parameterization for multiple payloads
   - Cover various attack vectors
   - Test multiple payload encodings

## Test Template Structure

```python
class Test{VulnerabilityID}:
    """Security tests for {Vulnerability Title}

    Vulnerability: {VULN_ID}
    Severity: {SEVERITY}
    Type: {VULNERABILITY_TYPE}

    These tests verify that {VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION}
    """

    def test_vulnerability_is_blocked(self):
        """Test that the vulnerability is properly blocked"""
        # Test implementation
        pass

    def test_legitimate_use_still_works(self):
        """Test that fixing the vulnerability didn't break normal functionality"""
        # Test implementation
        pass

    @pytest.mark.parametrize("payload", [
        # Various attack payloads
    ])
    def test_multiple_attack_vectors(self, payload):
        """Test that various attack vectors are blocked"""
        # Test implementation
        pass
```

## Output
Complete test file with comprehensive test coverage.
