# Attack Surface Analysis Workflow

## Objective
Identify and map all potential entry points and attack vectors in the codebase.

## Steps

1. **Identify Entry Points**
   - API endpoints and routes
   - User input fields (forms, search, filters)
   - File upload functionality
   - Authentication mechanisms
   - External integrations (webhooks, OAuth callbacks)
   - WebSocket connections
   - GraphQL/REST endpoints

2. **Map Data Flow**
   - Trace user input through the application
   - Identify trust boundaries
   - Document data transformation points
   - Find serialization/deserialization points

3. **Identify Trust Boundaries**
   - Unauthenticated → Authenticated
   - User → Admin
   - Client-side → Server-side
   - Internal → External services

4. **Document Attack Vectors**
   - Network-based attacks
   - Local attacks
   - Physical access attacks
   - Social engineering vectors

## Output
Generate attack surface map with all entry points categorized by risk.
