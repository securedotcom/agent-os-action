Subject: Request: Install GitHub App for Slack on securedotcom Organization

Hi [Admin Name],

I need your help installing the official GitHub app for Slack on our securedotcom organization.

WHAT I NEED:
Install the "GitHub" app for Slack on the securedotcom organization to enable automated code review notifications.

WHY:
We've implemented an automated code review system that creates PRs with security and quality findings. The GitHub app will notify our team in Slack when these PRs are created or updated.

HOW TO INSTALL (2 minutes):
1. Go to: https://github.com/organizations/securedotcom/settings/installations
2. Click "Install app" and search for "GitHub"
3. Select "All repositories" or add specific repos (Spring-Backend, spring-fabric, etc.)
4. Click "Install"

SECURITY:
✅ Official app by GitHub
✅ Used by thousands of organizations
✅ Only reads repository data (no write access to code)
✅ Can be uninstalled anytime

BENEFITS:
✅ Real-time PR notifications in Slack
✅ Automated code review alerts
✅ Better team collaboration
✅ Faster response to security issues

Detailed instructions: See attached GITHUB_APP_INSTALLATION_REQUEST.md

Please let me know if you need any additional information or have concerns about this installation.

Thanks!
