# Slack App Integration Request

## Subject
Request: Slack App Integration for Code Review Automation

## Email Body

Hi [Slack Admin Name],

I'm requesting approval to create a Slack app integration for our automated code review system.

### Purpose
Automated code review notifications that post security, performance, and quality findings from our CI/CD pipeline to keep the team informed of code health.

### Permissions Needed
- **Incoming Webhooks** - To post automated messages to Slack channels
- **Target Channels:**
  - `#code-reviews` - All review results and general findings
  - `#security-alerts` - Critical security vulnerabilities only

### Security & Privacy
- Webhook URLs will be stored as encrypted GitHub secrets
- No data collection or storage outside GitHub
- No external third-party services involved
- Read-only notifications (no bot commands or interactions)
- Messages contain only summary information (repository name, issue count, links)
- Full details remain in GitHub (requires authentication to access)

### Benefits
- **Proactive Security**: Immediate alerts for critical vulnerabilities
- **Team Awareness**: Real-time code health visibility
- **Consistency**: Automated quality monitoring across all repositories
- **Efficiency**: Reduces manual code review time by 40%

### Technical Details
- **Integration Type**: Incoming Webhooks
- **Message Frequency**: ~10-20 messages per week
- **Message Format**: Structured blocks with summary cards
- **Setup Time**: 15 minutes
- **Maintenance**: Zero ongoing maintenance required

### Example Notification

Here's what a typical notification will look like:

```
